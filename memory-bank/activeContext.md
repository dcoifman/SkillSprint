**Status**: [CURRENT]
**Last Updated**: 2024-05-29
**Version**: 1.0

## Introduction

This document tracks the current development focus, recent changes, next steps, and active decisions for the SkillSprint project.

## Executive Summary

SkillSprint is currently in Phase 1 (MVP Development), focused on building the core React application structure with basic UI components and frontend routing. The current implementation provides a foundation for the main features of the application.

## Key Points

- **Current Phase**: MVP Development (Phase 1)
- **Active Focus**: Core UI components and page structure
- **Recent Milestone**: Initial project setup and homepage design
- **Next Priority**: User authentication and data modeling
- **Critical Blockers**: None currently

## Current Work Focus

### Active Development

We are currently building the foundation of the SkillSprint application with:

1. **Project Structure**: Setting up the core directories, configurations, and dependencies
2. **Main Components**: Creating reusable UI components with Chakra UI
3. **Page Layout**: Implementing the main page structure and navigation flow
4. **Component Styling**: Establishing the design system and component theming

### Recently Completed

- Initial project setup with React, React Router, and Chakra UI
- Basic project file structure
- Home page with featured content sections
- Dashboard page with user progress and recommendations
- Sprint page with interactive learning content
- Profile page with user information and settings

### In Progress

- Data models for users, learning paths, and sprints
- API service layer structure
- Prototype learning path content structure
- State management approach (context API setup)

## Next Steps

### Immediate Tasks (Current Sprint)

1. Implement user authentication flow (registration, login, password reset)
2. Create API service layer for backend communication
3. Build learning path creator/editor with AI integration
4. Develop sprint content creation tools
5. Implement basic analytics tracking

### Upcoming Tasks (Next Sprint)

1. AI tutor integration
2. Personalized recommendation engine
3. Progress tracking and reporting
4. Offline mode capabilities
5. User settings and preferences

## Active Decisions & Considerations

### Under Discussion

- **AI Provider Selection**: Evaluating options for AI tutor integration (OpenAI vs. Anthropic)
- **Authentication Strategy**: Considering Firebase Auth vs. custom authentication solution
- **Content Storage**: Determining approach for storing and serving learning content
- **Testing Strategy**: Planning the testing approach for components and features

### Recently Decided

- **UI Framework**: Using Chakra UI for component library due to its accessibility and customization options
- **Styling Approach**: Theme-based styling with Chakra UI's built-in theming
- **Component Structure**: Modular component design with separation of concerns
- **Routing**: Using React Router for navigation and route management

## Current Challenges

- Ensuring responsive design works across all device sizes
- Planning the data structure for flexible learning content formats
- Optimizing performance for rapid content loading
- Balancing personalization features with privacy concerns

## Team Focus

- **Frontend Team**: Building core UI components and page structure
- **Design Team**: Finalizing detailed UI/UX specifications
- **Product Management**: Defining learning path structure and content requirements
- **Backend Team**: API planning and authentication strategy

## Dependencies & Integrations

- React Router for navigation
- Chakra UI for component library
- Context API for state management
- Planned integration with GPT for AI tutoring
