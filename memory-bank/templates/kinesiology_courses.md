## Implementation Notes

Each sprint should follow the established format in the SprintPage.js component:
- Content sections with concise, educational material
- Quiz components to test understanding
- Completion steps with key takeaways

Course paths should be added to the categories array in ExplorePathsPage.js with "Kinesiology" as a new category.

Each sprint should be designed for 5-15 minutes of focused learning, with a mix of:
- Educational content
- Visual aids (anatomy diagrams, movement illustrations)
- Interactive quizzes
- Practical application examples

## Technical Requirements

1. Add "Kinesiology" to the categories array in ExplorePathsPage.js
2. Create new learning path objects for each kinesiology course
3. Design individual sprint data objects following the pattern in SprintPage.js
4. Add appropriate images for course cards and content sections
5. Consider integrating 3D anatomy models for enhanced learning experience
